# n00b-Engine
A tile-based game engine written in RCBasic

This is the game engine I built for my personal projects. I am making it available for anyone who finds it useful. It requires
RCBasic v3.07 or greater to be installed in order to use. RCBasic itself is a programming language that I built for game development
and the latest build can be downloaded at http://www.rcbasic.com.
